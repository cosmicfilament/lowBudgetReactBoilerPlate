# Extremely Mediocre Low Budget React Boiler Platelet

This project assumes that you have installed it in a directory called ReactTemplate
If you install it in any other directory you will need to modify package.json.add

I use this package with git bash to:

1. run create-react-app

2. remove all of the testing related code and packages in the created project

3. add styled-components to the project and setup some initial css

4. add react-app-rewired and customize-cra to package.json along with a couple of styled component related packages

5. create the config-overrides.js module 

6. add a few vscode specific files and that's about it.

Not sure how useful this will be to anyone else, but all are free to use it.
