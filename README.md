# Extremely Mediocre Low Budget React Boiler Platelet

This project assumes that you have installed it in a directory called ReactTemplate
If you install it in any other directory you will need to modify the shell script RUNME.sh

I use this package with git bash to:

1. run create-react-app

2. remove all of the testing related code and packages in the created project

3. add styled-components to the project and setup some initial css

4. add react-app-rewired and customize-cra to package.json along with a couple of styled component related packages

5. create the config-overrides.js module 

6. add a few vscode specific files and that's about it.

Not sure how useful this will be to anyone else, but all are free to use it

To use the package, in git bash cd into the ReactTemplate directory and run the shell script RUNME.sh with the name of the react project that you want to create as the argument to the script.

Take a look at the RUNME.sh file and you will see exactly what is going on here.

It is pretty simple.
